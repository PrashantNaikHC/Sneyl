Simple android application which makes use of proximity sensor to trigger vibration.

In case of close proximity, the app will start vibrating the phone on regular interval. Vibration will stop if the proximity is distant.
This simple logic is employed to create a fun apo to vibrate and slide in a sloping surface and stop when it reaches the end.
